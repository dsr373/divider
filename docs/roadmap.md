# Roadmap
More of a wish list at this stage, to be honest.

## Core
 - [x] add description on Transaction
 - [x] remove the `.clones()`, at least in the interface if not in the core code
 - [ ] check for nonsensical values like negative benefits/contributions
 - [x] integrity check on a ledger by re-applying all transactions
 - [ ] ledger "resolution": who pays who to close all debts

## Backend
### Json store for a ledger
 - [ ] define schema for transaction
 - [ ] define schema for whole ledger?
 - [ ] implement parser
 - [ ] implement writer

## Frontend
### CLI or TUI
 - [ ] display balances and transactions
 - [ ] add a transaction or transfer

## Longer term goals
 - [ ] graphical UI
 - [ ] phone app
 - [ ] sharing of ledger with other people
 - [ ] authentication?
